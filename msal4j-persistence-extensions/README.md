# Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Java

The Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Java offers secure mechanisms for client applications to perform cross-platform token cache serialization and persistence. It gives additional support to the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Java (MSAL)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java). 

MSAL Java supports an in-memory cache by default and provides the `ITokenCacheAccessAspect` interface to perform cache serialization. You can read more about this in the MSAL Java [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-java-token-cache-serialization). Developers are required to implement their own cache persistance across multiple platforms and Microsoft Authentication Extensions makes this simpler.
The extensions library supports persistence of the cache to disk in encrypted form where the platform supports this.

This is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
- Windows - [DPAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection) is used for encryption.
- MAC - The MAC KeyChain is used and encryption is built in.
- Linux - [LibSecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) is used for encryption. Any place where libsecret is not available encryption is not supported.

> Note: It is recommended to use this library for cache persistance support for Public client applications such as Desktop apps only. In web applications, this may lead to scale and performance issues. Web applications are recommended to persist the cache in session. Take a look at this [webapp sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp).

## Usage

[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/com.microsoft.azure/msal4j-persistence-extension/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.microsoft.azure/msal4j-persistence-extension)

The Microsoft Authentication Extensions library provides the `PersistenceTokenCacheAccessAspect` which is an implementation of the `ITokenCacheAccessAspect` interface defined in MSAL Java. After configuring this token cache, it can then be used to instantiate the client application in MSAL Java. 

The token cache includes a file lock, and auto-reload behavior under the hood.

Here is the usage pattern for multiple platforms:

1. Configure the `PersistenceSettings`.

    ```java
    private PersistenceSettings createPersistenceSettings() throws IOException {

        Path path = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "MSAL", "testCache");

        return PersistenceSettings.builder("testCacheFile", path)
                .setMacKeychain("MsalTestService", "MsalTestAccount")
                .setLinuxKeyring(null,
                        "MsalTestSchema",
                        "MsalTestSecretLabel",
                        "MsalTestAttribute1Key",
                        "MsalTestAttribute1Value",
                        "MsalTestAttribute2Key",
                        "MsalTestAttribute2Value")
                .setLockRetry(1000, 50)
                .build();
    }
    ```

1. Create the `PersistenceTokenCacheAccessAspect`.

    ```java
    private ITokenCacheAccessAspect createPersistenceAspect() throws IOException {
        return new PersistenceTokenCacheAccessAspect(createPersistenceSettings());
    }
    ```
1. Now you can use `PersistenceTokenCacheAccessAspect` to configure Msal client application:

    ```java
    return PublicClientApplication.builder(PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID)
        .authority(AUTHORITY)
        .setTokenCacheAccessAspect(createPersistenceAspect())
        .build();
    ```
