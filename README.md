The Microsoft Authentication Library for Java (MSAL4J) enables applications to integrate with the [Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/). It allows you to sign in users or apps with Microsoft identities (Azure AD, Microsoft accounts and Azure AD B2C accounts) and obtain tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/) or your own APIs registered with the Microsoft identity platform. It is built using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

## Usage

MSAL4J supports multiple [application types and authentication scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-flows-app-scenarios).

Refer the [Wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki) pages for more details on the usage of MSAL Java and the supported scenarios.

## Migrating from ADAL
If your application is using ADAL for Java (ADAL4J), we recommend you to update to use MSAL4J. No new feature work will be done in ADAL4J.

See the [ADAL to MSAL migration](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/Migrate-to-MSAL-Java) guide.

## Roadmap

You can follow the latest updates and plans for MSAL Java in the [Roadmap](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki#roadmap) published on our Wiki.
