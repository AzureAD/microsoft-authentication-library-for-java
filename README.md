# Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java

The MSAL library for Java gives your app the ability to begin using the Microsoft Cloud by supporting Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Accounts in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

The library is currently in preview. During the preview we reserve the right to make changes to the API, cache format, and other mechanisms of this library without notice which you will be required to take along with bug fixes or feature improvements
