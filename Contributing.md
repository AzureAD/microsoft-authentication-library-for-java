# CONTRIBUTING

Microsoft Authentication Library for Java welcomes new contributors.  This document will guide you
through the process.

## CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

Please visit [https://cla.microsoft.com/](https://cla.microsoft.com/) and sign the Contributor License
Agreement.  You only need to do that once. We can not look at your code until you've submitted this request.


## Build

Use Java8.

## Test

Unit tests should run as expected. Integration tests require certificate / secrets which are deployed on CI. External contributors are not able to run integration tests manually.
